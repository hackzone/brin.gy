Status:
Brin.gy is a research project under heavy development. The codebase is still messy and some critical pieces of functionality are still missing, such as the ability to communicate with other users.

Running Brin.gy:
Three components are involved in running Brin.gy:
1) Agents module, which holds user data (USER -> ATTRIBUTES)
    
    python agents.py [-h HOST][-p PORT]

2) Discovery module, which performs the reverse queries for user discovery (ATTRIBUTE -> USERS)

    python satellite.py [-h HOST][-p PORT]
    
3) Web-based UI:
    
    cd website
    python website.py [-d SATELLITE_ADDRESS][-a AGENTS_ADDRESS]


Running Brin.gy locally:
	
1) First, make sure you have a running Redis server (http://redis.io/download). 
2) Install tornado:

	sudo easy_install tornado

3) Install redis for python:
	
	sudo easy_install redis

4) Then, run the following:

	python agents.py
	python satellite.py
	cd website
	python website.py -d localhost:22222 -a localhost:10007

5) Point your browser to http://localhost:8889
