Status:
Brin.gy is a research project under heavy development. The codebase is still messy and some critical pieces of functionality are still missing, such as the ability to communicate with other users.

Running Brin.gy:
Three components are involved in running Brin.gy:
1) Agents module, which holds user data (USER -> ATTRIBUTES)
    
    python agents.py [-h HOST][-p PORT]

2) Discovery module, which performs the reverse queries for user discovery (ATTRIBUTE -> USERS)

    python satellite.py [-h HOST][-p PORT]
    
3) Web-based UI:
    
    cd website
    python website.py [-d SATELLITE_ADDRESS][-a AGENTS_ADDRESS]
